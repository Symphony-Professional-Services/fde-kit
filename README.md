# FDE Kit

FDE Kit is a practical learning center and field toolkit for AI Forward Deployed Engineers (FDEs): engineers who work alongside customers to turn operational problems into adopted, governed production systems built on frontier models. It helps people learn the role, build the technical and customer craft, navigate engagements, and apply artifacts in real work.

## Who this is for

- **Learners** who want to become an AI FDE, at a frontier-model company or on an enterprise AI team. Start with the [curriculum](learning/curriculum/README.md).
- **Practitioners** starting or running an engagement. Start with the [stage playbook](stages/README.md).
- Delivery leaders and adjacent partners who need a shared model of the work.

## Engagement lifecycle

Every engagement follows a common spine:

**Discover → Frame → Design → Build → Deploy → Enable → Expand**

The lifecycle is a guide, not a one-way conveyor belt. New evidence can require the team to revisit an earlier decision; the goal is learning and delivered value, not simply advancing a stage. See the [engagement lifecycle](learning/engagement-lifecycle.md) for the loop-back rules.

## Find the right kind of help

| Area | Use it to answer | What belongs there |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Learning](learning/README.md) | What should I understand, and why does it matter? | Role, principles, lifecycle, system patterns, curriculum, glossary |
| [Stages](stages/README.md) | What should happen now? | Operational guidance for each lifecycle stage |
| [Skills](skills/README.md) | How do I perform a capability well? | Method, technical, and customer-craft guides that span stages |
| [Toolkit](toolkit/README.md) | What can I use right now? | Copy-ready field artifacts |
| [Examples](examples/README.md) | What does good FDE work look like? | A completed fictional engagement |
| [Agents](agents/README.md) | How does my agent harness run the method? | Agent skills that wrap the guides and templates |

## What is in the kit

- **Eleven skill guides.** Four method guides (workflow discovery, human/software/AI system design, evaluation and staged rollout, adoption and feedback), five technical guides (context engineering, tool-using agents, retrieval and grounding, grader design and error analysis, production readiness), and two customer-craft guides (discovery interviewing and facilitation, executive communication).
- **Thirteen toolkit artifacts.** From the discovery interview guide and stakeholder map, through the pilot charter, responsibility matrix, AI security review, evaluation pack, rollout plan, and operating plan, to the business case, executive readout, and field report.
- **[AI system patterns](learning/system-patterns.md)** with diagrams: assist; extract, validate, act; retrieval-grounded assistant; tool-using agent; batch classification and routing.
- **A seven-module [curriculum](learning/curriculum/README.md)** ending in a capstone engagement with a rubric, plus a [glossary](learning/glossary.md).
- **The [AI Implementation Field Playbook](learning/presentations/fde-overview.html)**, a 16-slide deck. GitHub displays HTML source, so clone the repository and open the file in a browser.
- **The [AI-assisted invoice-intake engagement](examples/invoice-intake-ai/README.md)**, a fictional worked example showing every stage and the seven original artifacts working together.
- **Six [agent skills](agents/README.md)** in the AI-DLC convention, so an FDE can run a workflow trace, opportunity scorecard, responsibility matrix, evaluation pack, security review, or field report from inside Claude Code, Codex, or a similar harness.

## Start here

### Learner path

1. Read [What is an FDE?](learning/what-is-an-fde.md), the [operating principles](learning/operating-principles.md), and the [engagement lifecycle](learning/engagement-lifecycle.md).
2. Work through the [curriculum](learning/curriculum/README.md) in order. Each module produces an artifact; the capstone runs a fictional engagement end to end.
3. Apply the capstone learnings to real-world customer engagements.

### Active-engagement path

1. Use the [engagement lifecycle](learning/engagement-lifecycle.md) to identify the current stage and its expected transition.
2. Open the [stage page](stages/README.md) for the current work and exit criteria; it names the guides and artifacts for that stage.
3. Apply the relevant [skill guide](skills/README.md) and copy the matching [toolkit artifact](toolkit/README.md), or run the matching [agent skill](agents/README.md) in your harness.
4. Choose the [system pattern](learning/system-patterns.md) that meets the outcome with the least autonomy, and complete the [AI security review](toolkit/ai-security-review.md) before Deploy.
5. Compare the evidence chain with the completed [invoice-intake example](examples/invoice-intake-ai/README.md), adapting its thresholds and boundaries to the engagement at hand.

### Stage playbook

1. [Discover](stages/01-discover/README.md)
2. [Frame](stages/02-frame/README.md)
3. [Design](stages/03-design/README.md)
4. [Build](stages/04-build/README.md)
5. [Deploy](stages/05-deploy/README.md)
6. [Enable](stages/06-enable/README.md)
7. [Expand](stages/07-expand/README.md)

## Direction and contribution

The [roadmap](docs/roadmap.md) records what has shipped and what comes next; the [discovery review](docs/reviews/2026-09-07-fde-kit-review.md) records the evidence behind it. [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) states the quality bar, content conventions, required schemas, and the [AI-DLC](AI-DLC.md) workflow the repository uses. Every numeric rule in the kit is a starting heuristic, not an industry standard.
