### Learning additions

- `learning/curriculum/README.md` and modules `01-role-and-operating-model.md`, `02-discovery-and-framing.md`, `03-system-design.md`, `04-evaluation-engineering.md`, `05-production-and-day-two.md`, `06-customer-craft.md`, `07-capstone.md`. Module schema: Outcome, Prerequisites, Study, Exercise, Assessment, Next.
- `learning/glossary.md`: terms used across the kit with one-sentence definitions and links.
- `learning/system-patterns.md`: assist, extract-validate-act, retrieval-grounded assistant, tool-using agent, batch classification and routing. Each with a Mermaid diagram, when to use, boundary and evaluation notes, and links to skills.
- Mermaid diagrams added inline to `learning/engagement-lifecycle.md` (lifecycle loop) and `learning/what-is-an-fde.md` (operating model and artifacts).

### Agent skills

`agents/README.md` explains installation (copy a skill directory into `.claude/skills/` or `.agents/skills/`, or manage it through AI-DLC) and the design rule: a skill supplies judgment and points to the human guide and template; it never replaces them. Skills: `fde-workflow-trace`, `fde-opportunity-scorecard`, `fde-responsibility-matrix`, `fde-eval-pack`, `fde-security-review`, `fde-field-report`. Each SKILL.md has `name` and `description` frontmatter, a short procedure, the evidence it must ask for, the template path, and completion checks.

### Repository workflow

AI-DLC adopted with the generic preset and `scm` plus `agent-client` capabilities. Checks: `generated`, `links`, `schemas`, `whitespace`. CI runs the check scripts directly. `CONTRIBUTING.md` carries the quality bar and content conventions.

## User journey and states

Learner: `README.md` → `learning/curriculum/README.md` → modules in order → capstone. Every module links the guides and artifacts it uses, so the learner reads the practitioner material in a sequence.

Practitioner: `README.md` → stage page → skill guide → toolkit artifact → agent skill when working in a harness → example for comparison.

## System boundaries and interfaces

- Section boundaries are unchanged. Agent skills are a tooling layer under `agents/`, not a content category.
- Interfaces between files are relative links; the link check enforces them.
- Schemas are enforced by `scripts/check_schemas.py`; a new content type must add its schema there in the same change.

## Decisions and rationale

- [ADR 0001](../decisions/0001-adopt-ai-dlc.md): adopt AI-DLC for the workflow; CI runs the checks manifest directly.
- [ADR 0002](../decisions/0002-agent-skills-wrap-human-guides.md): agent skills follow the AI-DLC packaging convention and wrap human guides.
- [ADR 0003](../decisions/0003-mermaid-for-diagrams.md): Mermaid in Markdown is the diagram source.

## Behavioral contract

Acceptance criteria live in each work record under `.ai-dlc/work/`. No formal specification provider is configured; each record states `requires_spec = false` with its reason.

## Verification strategy

- `ai-dlc project check --required` locally; CI runs the same scripts.
- One reviewer pass per new file against the quality bar in `CONTRIBUTING.md`: specific, evidence-oriented, heuristics labeled, good and weak patterns concrete, links into stages and artifacts.
- Manual read of the learner path end to end after all modules exist.

## Delivery and recovery

Delivery slices map one to one to work records and can land in any order after `repository-workflow`. Each slice is additive; rollback is reverting the slice's commit. Index updates (`README.md`, section READMEs, stage Related capabilities) land with the slice that adds the linked files so no index ever points at a missing file.

## Traceability

- Work records: `.ai-dlc/work/*.toml`
- Branch: `claude/fde-kit-review-buildout-yh03mj`
- Discovery: `docs/reviews/2026-09-07-fde-kit-review.md`
- Roadmap: `docs/roadmap.md`
