# AI FDE curriculum

A sequenced path from understanding the AI forward deployed engineer (FDE) role to running a fictional engagement end to end. Each module reads the kit's practitioner material in order, then makes you produce the artifact a real engagement would need at that point. By the capstone you will have written every artifact from Discover to Expand for a scenario you did not choose and scored it against the [invoice-intake example](../../examples/invoice-intake-ai/README.md).

## Who it is for

- An engineer who wants to become an AI FDE and needs more than a reading list: a sequence, exercises with outputs, and a way to tell whether the output is any good.
- A practitioner filling specific gaps. Jump to the gap, but do the exercise, not only the reading; the artifacts are where the method becomes visible.

It assumes you can write code against a model provider's application programming interface (API), read a JSON schema, and talk with an operations manager without a script.

## How to use it

1. Do the modules in order. Each builds on the previous artifact: module 03 designs the wedge module 02 chartered, and module 06 writes the readout from module 04 and 05 results.
2. Produce the artifact. Every module ends with a concrete output using a [toolkit](../../toolkit/README.md) template. Reading without producing does not complete a module.
3. Score it. Assessments are self-scored rubrics with three levels: developing, solid, strong. For each criterion, name the evidence in your artifact that supports the level.
4. Get it reviewed. A reviewer, such as a peer working through the curriculum, a mentor, or a practitioner who has shipped an AI system to production, makes the rubrics far more useful. Ask them to challenge your evidence, not your formatting. Without a reviewer, swap artifacts with another learner; scoring someone else's work teaches almost as much as writing your own.
5. Keep one folder per engagement. The capstone reuses the structure.

## Expected effort

As a starting heuristic, not an industry standard: six to eight weeks at five to seven hours per week, with the capstone taking about a third of the total. Modules 03 and 04 take longest because they include building against real tooling; recalibrate after module 02.

## Modules

| Number | Title | What you produce |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 01 | [The role and the operating model](01-role-and-operating-model.md) | A one-page explanation of the seven-move operating model applied to a workflow you know |
| 02 | [Discovery and framing](02-discovery-and-framing.md) | Two workflow traces, two interview records, a stakeholder map, a scored opportunity scorecard, a pilot charter |
| 03 | [System design: boundaries, context, tools, retrieval](03-system-design.md) | A responsibility matrix, a justified pattern choice, an output contract with an abstain value, tool contracts and permission tiers, a first-pass security review |
| 04 | [Evaluation engineering](04-evaluation-engineering.md) | A stratified case set, graders, a calibrated judge or its calibration plan, an error-analysis pass, an evaluation pack with a release decision |
| 05 | [Production, rollout, and Day 2](05-production-and-day-two.md) | A rollout plan with gates and signals, an operating plan with Day 2 owners, a rollback rehearsal script |
| 06 | [Customer craft and communication](06-customer-craft.md) | An executive readout, the operator version of the same facts, a field report, written responses to two hard conversations |
| 07 | [Capstone: run a fictional engagement end to end](07-capstone.md) | Every artifact from Discover to Expand for a scenario seed, a limitations section, a weighted self-score |

## What the curriculum does not do

It does not replace building a real system. Written artifacts can be internally consistent and still wrong about how a model, a retrieval index, or an enterprise connector behaves. Every module therefore says where to practice with real tooling: a model API with structured output, a small retrieval index over documents you can inspect, a tracing store you can query, and a case set you run more than once. If you cannot run a model, modules 03 to 05 say what to write instead; your self-score should say so.

It does not certify anyone; a strong capstone score is evidence of practical understanding, not a credential. And it does not teach one vendor's software development kit (SDK): the kit names mechanisms, vendor documentation teaches the API calls.
